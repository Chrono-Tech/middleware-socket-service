##### About
This module is used for translating messages from amqp (messages from other middlewares)
and send to auth subscribers through native sockets

#### How does it work?

##### AUTH MESSAGE
Client must authorizing to service through laborx Profile service
that send auth message after 10 sec after open connection
```
{ 
    type: 'AUTH',
    token: 'sdfsdfsdfsdf'
}
```
where
type = AUTH
token = token from laborx profile service


##### SUBSCRIBE MESSAGE

Client subscribe to get messages from this service,
send message this format

```
{ 
    type: 'SUBSCRIBE',
    routing: 'app_eth.transaction.*'
}
```

where 
type = SUBSCRIBE
routing = name routingKey in amqpMessages

##### UNSUBSCRIBE MESSAGE

Client unsubscribe to get messages from middlewares, that match to routingKey
send message this format

```
{ 
    type: 'UNSUBSCRIBE',
    routing: 'app_eth.transaction.*'
}
```

### How client get messages from service

Client get messages from this service as such format

```
{
    routing: 'app_eth.transaction.*',
    data: {
        hash: 'sdfsfdsdfs',
        id: 'ffgdgdf'
    }
}
```

where
routing - routingKey, as client send in connection before
data - data from middleware for this routingKey
[see appropriate middleware documentation]

RABBIT_SERVICE_NAME=socket
RABBIT_EXCHANGE=events
LABORX_URI=http://localhost:3001
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/data
```

The options are presented below:
